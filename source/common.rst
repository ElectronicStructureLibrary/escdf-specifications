Global Specifications
=====================

File structure
--------------

The ESCDF file format is based on
`HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5>`__. An HDF5 file contains mainly
two types of objects: groups and datasets (see the HDF5 documentation
for further details). The groups are arranged in a way that is similar
to a file system. The root group of an HDF5 file is denoted as "/",
while "/foo" refers to a group named "foo" that is stored in the file
root group.

The data stored following the ESCDF specifications should be stored
within one group, which we will hereafter refer to as the ESCDF root
group. Quite often this will be the actual root group of the HDF5 file,
but it can also be any other group within the file. This means that a
given HDF5 file might contain more than one ESCDF root group, thus
storing information about several independent systems/calculations.

The contents of the ESCDF root group are further divided into global
variables and groups. The global variables are used for a general
description of the file, mainly the file format convention, while the
groups contain the actual data. The names of the allowed groups are the
following:

-  **system**
-  **basis\_sets**
-  **densities**
-  **potentials**
-  **states**
-  **extensions**

As suggested by their names, the groups are used to store different
types of data. A detailed description of the global variables and the
groups can be found in the following sections.

The simplest use case consist in storing the information generated by a
single calculation for a given system, but one might also want to store
information about several calculation and/or systems in the same file.
Here is how the file structure could look like for differenct use cases:

-  One system, one calculation:

| ``/system``
| ``/densities``
| ``/basis_sets``
| ``/basis_sets/foo``
| ``/basis_sets/bar``

In this case the file contains the description of one system and the
data of one density, but two basis sets named **foo** and **bar**.

-  Many systems, one calculation:

| ``/system/foo``
| ``/system/bar``
| ``/densities``

In this case the file contains the description of two systems named
**foo** and **bar**, but only one density. This could correspond to a
case where the total density of two systems is obtained from a single
calculation.

-  Many systems, one calculation per system:

| ``/id1/system``
| ``/id1/basis_sets``
| ``/id1/densities``
| ``/id2/system``
| ``/id2/basis_sets``
| ``/id2/densities``

In this case the file contains two ESCDF root groups named **id1** and
**id2**. Each one of these groups contains the description of one
system, one basis set and the data of one density.

Global variables
----------------

The ESCDF root group must have the following attributes:

-  **file\_format**
-  **file\_format\_version**
-  **Conventions**

The ESCDF root group may also have the following optional attributes:

-  **history**
-  **title**

Global attributes provide general information on the file format being
used, as well as the contents and history of the file.

-  **file\_format**: char(80) (always ``ESCDF``)
   The name of the data standard.

-  **file\_format\_version**: float (e.g., ``1.1``, ``1.2``, ``2.0``,
   etc.)
   Version number for the data standard.

-  **Conventions**: char(80) (e.g., ``http://esl.cecam.org/``)
   Where the data standard specifications can be found on the Internet.

-  **history**: char(1024)
   Each code modifying/writing the file is encouraged to add a line
   about itself in the history attribute. char(1024) allows for 12
   additions of at most 80 characters.

-  **title**: char(80)
   A short description of the contents of the file (i.e., the physical
   system).

Global conventions
------------------

Flag-like variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HDF5 does not support a boolean datatype. Flag-like variables should be
stored as char(3), with allowed values ``yes`` and ``no``. When such
attributes are written, they should be written in full length and small
letters. When they are read, only the first character needs to be
checked (i.e., ``y`` or ``n``).

Dimensional variables (physical units)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most variables are dimensionless. If a variable does have physical
dimensions, the default is to use Hartree atomic units. However,
different units can be specified by including two optional attributes to
the variable (if it is a dataset):

-  **scale\_to\_atomic\_units**: double
   The appropriate value in atomic units is obtained by multiplying the
   number found in the variable by this scaling factor. For example, if
   an energy variable is recorded in eV, **scale\_to\_atomic\_units**
   should be set to ``0.036749326``.

-  **units**: char(80)
   The name or definition of the units being used. This attribute is
   only used for informative purposes; only **scale\_to\_atomic\_units**
   should be used to read the file.
